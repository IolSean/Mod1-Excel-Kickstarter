# Notional Advice to Louise
* 'Theater' is the largest category of Kickstarters and the category is comparatively successful. (M1_PivotChart1)
* A late spring to early summer launch of the kickstarter would be the most auspicious. (M1_PivotChart2)
* A granular analysis of your Edinburgh faves is a good reference for successful Kickstarter 'Goal', 'Pledged', 'Average Donation', & 'Number of Backers' values. (M1_PVLookUP_Spreadsheet)
* A macro-level comparative statistical analysis of all successful and failed U.S. Kickstarter 'Plays' (M1_DescriptiveStatistics_Spreadsheet) behoove you to,
  1. Keep your 'Goal' value around $3000 in most cases and no more than $5000 if it's "fire".
  2. If the 'Goal' value is good you can expect to outraise.
* Specifically in regard to Kickstarter 'Musicals', You should aim for a production cost of less than Â£4,000. (M1_GB_Musical_PledgeGoal_IQR)
### Challenge
* Currency in the charts are in multiple denominations because the FX changes over time and conversion wouldn't be prudent and, therefore, the data formatted as general.
* The 'Outcomes' data attribute is in quotation marks for the chart titles because 'Live' values are not yet concluded.
* There are no canceled kickstarter plays so their success rate was not included in the Goal chart.
* I was unsure if the dataset is proprietary to UCB or if it is too large based on what I though I heard in lecture, but the challenge assignment seems to ask for it so I've incuded it.
* 'Play' 'Theater' Kickstarter outomes are fail when goals are too high and are succede when goals are modest or in a narrow 35-40k sweetspot. (M1_OutcomesGoal_Chart)
* Theater kickstartrs succede least in fall and most from April to August and in Febuary. (M1_OutomesDate_Chart)
