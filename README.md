# Notional Advice to Louise
* 'Theater' is the largest category of Kickstarters and the category is comparatively successful. (M1_PivotChart1)
* A late spring to early summer launch of the kickstarter would be the most auspicious. (M1_PivotChart2)
* A granular analysis of your Edinburgh faves is a good reference for successful Kickstarter 'Goal', 'Pledged', 'Average Donation', & 'Number of Backers' values. (M1_PVLookUP_Spreadsheet)
* A macro comparative statistical analysis of all successful and failed U.S. Kickstarter 'Plays' (M1_DescriptiveStatistics_Spreadsheet) behoove you to,
  1. Keep your 'Goal' value around $3000 in most cases and no more than $5000 if it's "fire".
  2. If the 'Goal' value is good you can expect to outraise.
* Specifically in regard to Kickstarter 'Musicals', You should aim for a production cost of less than Â£4,000. (M1_GB_Musical_PledgeGoal_IQR)
